## Classified Developer Notes 🛰️

If you’re reading this, you clicked where you weren’t told to click.

Good.

### Why this exists
This page wasn’t built for everyone.
It was built for curious people—the kind who tap things twice, then five times, then say:
> “Okay but what if…”

Curiosity is not a bug.
It’s a feature.

---

### Why Voyager?
Voyager is a real machine, launched in 1977, still talking to us from interstellar space.
No updates. No retries. No undo.

Just:
- exploration
- patience
- and the belief that *something is worth sending, even if no one answers*

That felt… relevant.

---

### How you got here
There was no button.
No instruction.
No sign.

You interacted.
You experimented.
You persisted.

That’s the whole test.

---

### Technical notes (because of course)
- This site is intentionally simple.
- No frameworks needed.
- No tracking.
- No data collected.
- No reward promised.

The interaction itself *is* the reward.

---

### Philosophy
Most people stop at six.

You didn’t.

That tells me enough.

---

### Final note
If you’re building things:
- hide something just for the curious
- reward attention, not speed
- assume someone smarter than you will find it

They always do.
